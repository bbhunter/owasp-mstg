title: WKNavigationDelegate Accepting Any Server Certificate
code: [swift]
id: MASTG-DEMO-0155
test: MASTG-TEST-0397
kind: fail
---

## Sample

The code below implements `WKNavigationDelegate` with a `webView(_:didReceive:completionHandler:)` override that calls `completionHandler(.useCredential, URLCredential(trust: serverTrust))` without first successfully evaluating the server's trust object. This accepts any certificate the server presents in a `WKWebView`, regardless of whether it is expired, self-signed, or issued for the wrong hostname, allowing the HTTPS connection to proceed even when the server certificate would otherwise be rejected.

The WebView is used to load `self-signed.badssl.com`, which serves a self-signed certificate. As explained in [Apple's documentation on manual server trust authentication](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/performing-manual-server-trust-authentication), such certificates are ordinarily rejected unless explicitly trusted. A correctly implemented delegate using the system's default trust policy would reject this certificate.

## Steps

1. Extract the app (@MASTG-TECH-0058) and locate the main binary `./Payload/MASTestApp.app/MASTestApp`.
2. Run @MASTG-TOOL-0073 with the script to identify the WKNavigationDelegate authentication challenge handler and determine whether a server-trust evaluation API such as `SecTrustEvaluateWithError` or `SecTrustEvaluateAsyncWithError` is called.

{{ webview_auth_challenge.r2 }}

{{ run.sh }}

## Observation

The output contains five sections followed by the disassembly file for the handler:

- **Custom authentication-challenge handlers**: lists every function whose signature references `NSURLAuthenticationChallenge`. `InsecureWKNavigationDelegate` (`0x00004000`) appears here because it implements a custom authentication-challenge handler. This is a broad signal that the handler warrants review for custom server-trust handling.
- **Accessors into the challenge protection space**: the `objc_msgSend$protectionSpace` (`0x00015980`) and `objc_msgSend$serverTrust` (`0x000159e0`) stubs confirm the app reaches into `challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust`, an indication of manual server-trust handling.
- **xrefs to WKNavigationDelegate challenge handler implementation**: `axff` on the ObjC challenge handler method shows its call to the Swift implementation. `InsecureWKNavigationDelegate`'s ObjC method (`0x41f8`) calls the Swift implementation at `0x00004000`.
- **Server-trust evaluation calls**: this section is empty. No supported server-trust evaluation API is called by the challenge handler.
- **xrefs to server-trust evaluation APIs**: empty for the same reason.

Reviewing the disassembled code (@MASTG-TECH-0076), the disassembly and AI-reversed Swift below confirm the insecure handler:

## Evaluation

`InsecureWKNavigationDelegate` surfaces in the "Custom authentication-challenge handlers" section and accesses `challenge.protectionSpace.serverTrust`, so it performs custom server-trust handling and warrants manual review.

The test case fails because the handler accepts a credential created from `serverTrust` without successfully evaluating that trust object.

The disassembly confirms this:

- `serverTrust` is obtained at `0x00004064`.
- the only check is a `nil` guard at `0x0000408c` (`cbz x0, 0x4120`).
- `NSURLCredential` is created directly at `0x000040d8`, and the resulting credential is accepted without a successful server-trust evaluation.

The AI-reversed Swift makes the pattern explicit: any non-`nil` trust object presented to the `WKWebView` is accepted unconditionally.
